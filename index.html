            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Matt Ward, and I'm passionate about coding, golf and my family. 
                When I'm not immersed in writing code or learning new programming languages, 
                you can often find me out on the golf course, enjoying the challenge and relaxation it brings. 
                As a sports enthusiast, I love watching basketball, football, golf, and baseball, with a special 
                place in my heart for my favorite teams, including Texas Tech's football, baseball, and basketball teams, 
                the Dallas Cowboys, and the Texas Rangers.</p>

            <p>However, my biggest joy in life comes from spending time with my wonderful family. 
                I'm lucky to have my wife Jami by my side, who always supports and encourages me in my pursuits. 
                We have two amazing sons, William, who is six years old, and Jackson, who is three years old. 
                They bring so much joy and laughter to our lives, and I cherish every moment we spend together.</p>
                
                <p>Combining my love for coding, sports, and family, I strive to bring dedication, creativity, and 
                    problem-solving skills to my projects. I'm excited to connect with potential employers and explore
                    opportunities that align with my interests and expertise. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss 
                    any collaborative ventures or to simply chat about coding, sports, or life! </p>
